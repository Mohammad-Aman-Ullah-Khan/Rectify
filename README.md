# Microsoft Engage Mentorship program'22 project 
## Rectify - Automated Exam Proctoring tool for Online Exams using Face Recognition
### ðŸš© Overview 
During COVID 19 pandemic, online education has become a common norm in schools and colleges, and students themselves are adapted to this online environment of education, as classes are being held in online mode, exams are also conducted online and students tend to cheat in those exams due to lack of security and no physical guarding by professors/teachers, so here is my solution to the problem!

**Rectify** - An automated online proctoring tool that uses **facial recognition** to detect activities of examinees live during the exam and report live analysis to the professor
This is solely built during the period of **Microsoft Engage Mentorship program'22** conducted by Microsoft provide mentorship and to enrich freshmen with various software development techniques.

#### Problem statement (as given)
